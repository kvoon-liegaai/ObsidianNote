## 枚举

枚举分类

数字类型枚举

>  这些枚举类型的值都是数字类型，因此它们被称为数字类型枚举

```ts
enum WeekDay{
	Monday,
  Tuesday,
  Wednesday,
  Thursday,
  Friday,
  Saturday,
  Sunday
}

// 简单的使用枚举类型
let day = WeekDay.Monday;

//类型安全
day = "kwongliegaai" //报错，Error: string 不能复制给 "Monday" 类型
```

JS 源代码

```js
var WeekDay;
(function (WeekDay) {
    WeekDay[WeekDay["Monday"] = 0] = "Monday";
    WeekDay[WeekDay["Tuesday"] = 1] = "Tuesday";
    WeekDay[WeekDay["Wednesday"] = 2] = "Wednesday";
    WeekDay[WeekDay["Thursday"] = 3] = "Thursday";
    WeekDay[WeekDay["Friday"] = 4] = "Friday";
    WeekDay[WeekDay["Saturday"] = 5] = "Saturday";
    WeekDay[WeekDay["Sunday"] = 6] = "Sunday";
})(WeekDay || (WeekDay = {}));
```

因此 

1. ` WeekDay[0] == "Monday" `
2. ` WeekDay["MonDay"] == 0 `


### 改变与数字枚举关联的数字

默认情况下，第一个枚举值是 `0`，然后以步长为 `1` 依次递增

```ts
enum Color{
	Red, //0
	Green, //1
	Blue //2
}

```
